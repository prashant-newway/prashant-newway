### Hi there 👋
My Name is Prashant as you may be able to see from my username . I have completed my engineering and masters in Physics from BITS Pilani .I have started slow , confused and curious which has led me to understand and pivot to my desired work which I wanna do .
I am currently working as a Data Analyst in Hyd which has helpmed in upderstanding deeply about data and systems around it.
This has led me to work within and outside of my job more in data engineering systems.
So I will be giving the latest update on the books , courses and projects which I am doing or part of.

I am currently 
1. reading Data Pipelines Pocket Reference - just to get more understanding of these systems.
2. learning RDBMS and Data modelling through Standford online.
3. learning Big Data application through UC Sandiago Cousera
4. learning Data Warehouse BI Specialization through University of Colorado
5. Python learning
6. DE projects
7. starting statical analysis using Excel and Python.


next in my reading list-
1.Linear systems book
2.Designing Data Intensive Application book
3.Intro to DE
4.System Performance
5.Reading in Database Systems
6.Architecture of Database System
